## Free Joomla! Plugins and Modules

Joomla! is a powerful CMS, but too often, [I](https://brettvachon.com) found the need to write custom code for simple features.

I've decided to vibe-code extensions and plugins to eliminate this frustration and improve website maintenance.

### [Dropbox Embed Content Plugin](Dropboxembed)

Embed your Dropbox files and folders into your Joomla site using a simple shortcode and the power of the Dropbox Embedder, without fiddling with HTML code.

### [TF Learnpath Module](TfLearnpath)

TF Learn by Joomla Fry is a great LMS for Joomla! But students found navigation hard to use. This module makes it easier for students to find their lessons.

### [Xchimp2 User Plugin](Xchimp2)

The Xchimp2 module allows user information to be sent to Mailchimp upon user save (subscribe or update a user).
