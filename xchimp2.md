# Xchimp2 — Mailchimp User Plugin for Joomla!

Xchimp2 makes it simple to connect your Joomla! user registration system to Mailchimp. Once installed and configured, it will automatically subscribe new users to your chosen Mailchimp list.

## Why Use Xchimp2?
Joomla! 3 had several great free plugins, but many of them stopped working after the API upgrades starting with Joomla! 4. XChimp is one of those free Mailchimp integrations which I updated to work with the new Joomla! plugin API.
Whether you're running a membership site, or an eCommerce store, Xchimp2 helps you automatically sync your users with your Mailchimp mailing lists—no manual exports required!

## Features
- **Effortless Mailchimp Integration** – Seamlessly sync Joomla! users on your site with your Mailchimp lists.
- **Automatic Subscription** – New Joomla! users are added to Mailchimp as soon as they are saved, with option to add tags.
- **Update existing contacts** – Update tags on existing contacts and confirm their subscription via email.
- **Easy Setup** – Just enter your API key, choose from all available Mailchimp lists and assign users accordingly.

## Installation Instructions
1. Install the plugin via Joomla! Extensions Manager.
2. Enable the plugin under `Extensions > Plugins > User - Xchimp2`.
3. Enter your Mailchimp API key in the plugin settings.
4. Select which Mailchimp list new users should be subscribed to.
5. Customize options like **double opt-in** and **list selection**.
6. Save your settings, and you're good to go!

## Contributions
The original XChimp plugin was developed by **ThemeXpert** as [XChimp](https://www.themexpert.com/joomla-extensions/xchimp). 
Xchimp2 is my attempt to keep Mailchimp integration alive for modern Joomla! sites. 

The plugin uses the [![Drewm Mailchimp API](https://travis-ci.org/drewm/mailchimp-api.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/drewm/mailchimp-api)
